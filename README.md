# Swift

### Started with varibles, constant and static in Swift

### Understood why to use states like Stirg, Int, Bool, Double, Float

### Write Functions in swift
- How to pass parameters
- return Type

### Started with Classes and Struct

- Inheritence
- Constructors / Initilizers

### Loops
- For in

  ### Usual Synatx
    - var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
      for x in arr {
          print(x)
      }
      
    ### By default x is an constant here so if we have to change the value of the number so we can make it var
      - var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
        for var x in arr {
            x = 2*x
            print(x)
        }
        
    ### We can also iterate by indices for that this is the synatx
      - for i in arr.indices {
            print(arr[i])
        }
- While

### Optionals and wrapping
- String?, Int?
- if let val = s 

### Conditional Statements

### Gurad Statements

### Enums and Switch

### Protocols

### Closures
